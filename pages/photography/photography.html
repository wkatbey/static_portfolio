                    I'm fascinated by buildings. I admire their fascades and love exploring their
                    interiors. I love to gaze at cityscapes and skylines. Additionally, I have a burning passion for aviation. I enjoy taking photos of aircraft whenever I get the chance.
                    I express my love for these structures through idealized photographs.

                <p class="body-text">
                    In a way, I like to take those things that make me happy, and romanticize them. I enjoy structure, and so I will take something that's fascinating to me and make it so it appears even more compelling.

                I'm an amateur photographer. I don't know much about photography. I only really use my iPhone to take photos. If I find I'm not satisfied with the quality of image I'm getting from my current collection, I will learn more photography. However, for the time being, this is outside my scope, as I'm currently devoted to software engineering.

                As a software engineer in practice, I'm resposible for writing a script that is elegant, not just functional. A script that is structured, that can be understood through class dependency, self-documenting code, and so on. I like to make things I like look appealing.

                There are several midtown/downtown areas within my backyard. In early May, 2018, I traveled outside my scope to New York City. I'm going to create an album of photos taken on that trip, 
                and display them here.
